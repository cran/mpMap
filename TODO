Future Fixes:
--------------------
* Modify fit.mpqtl function to fit QTL as random effects instead of as fixed 
* Modify fit.mpqtl function to output percent variance explained by QTL
* Modify findqtl2 to find all QTL peaks in a profile
* Function to convert pedigrees so that the number of selfing generations is 
	stored in last column rather than observation status
* Functionality for estimating recombination fractions and interval mapping
	for 16-parent MAGIC
* Function to compare position of detected QTL across multiple maps
* Function to display haplotypes in vicinity of detected QTL
* Function to display heterozygosity in vicinity of detected QTL
	Ouptut which lines are het and how large the stretch of hets is
* Function for single marker analysis - will not require completely 
	inbred lines (like mpcross structure) so that hets can be tested
* Incorporation of GPU code to compute recombination fractions and LD 
	(if GPU is available on system)
* Improve speed of fillmiss for markers which are not coded as 0/1
