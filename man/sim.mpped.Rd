  sim.mpped(nfounders, nfunnels = 1, nperfam = 50,
    nssdgen = 6, nseeds = 1, iripgen = 0, seed = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{nfounders}{Number of founders in the pedgiree}

  \item{nfunnels}{Number of different permutations of
  founder crosses (funnels) to generate.}

  \item{nperfam}{Number of plants per funnel (before
  selfing begins)}

  \item{nssdgen}{Number of generations of single-seed
  descent (selfing)}

  \item{nseeds}{Number of seeds propagated from each plant
  through SSD}

  \item{iripgen}{Number of generations of advanced
  intercrossing between mixing and selfing}

  \item{seed}{Random seed for selecting funnels to
  generate}

  \item{\dots}{Additional arguments}

\value{
  Matrix with four columns: ID, mother, father, and
  observed status

\description{
  Generates pedigrees for 4-way or 8-way MAGIC designs,
  with specifications given by the user. These pedigrees
  can be used to simulate datasets with other functions in
  the mpMap package.
}
\details{
  The 4-way pedigree is relatively simple compared to the
  8-way pedigree, as there are many fewer possible
  combinations of lines to intercross. For a 4-way cross
  there is a maximum of 3 possible funnels (ABCD, ACBD and
  ADBC), while there are 315 for an 8-way cross. This is
  computed under the assumption that cross AB is equivalent
  to cross BA.

  For a value of 1, the funnel will be of the form ABCD or
  ABCDEFGH. For values less than the maximum possible
  number of funnels the crosses will be selected randomly,
  with each possibly funnel having equal probability of
  being generated.
