\usage{
  \method{clean}{mpcross} (object, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{Object of class \code{mpcross}}

  \item{...}{Additional arguments}
}
\value{
  \item{alleles}{Number of alleles at each marker}
  \item{missing}{Percent missing data at each marker}
  \item{seg}{Matrix with one row for each marker and
  columns for the marker name, the chisquare test for
  segregation distortion, and the p-value of the test}
}
\description{
  Given an object of class 'mpcross', the function checks
  that the data is in the correct format, containing
  founder and final genotypes, ids, and a pedigree. The
  number of markers genotyped for both founders and finals
  should coincide. The pedigree should be completely
  numeric. Markers which are not polymorphic across the
  founders are removed, as are markers which have missing
  values in the founders.
}
\details{
  Summary statistics for the genotypes are printed,
  included the number of markers with varying levels of
  missing data, with varying levels of segregation
  distortion, and with different numbers of alleles.
