\usage{
  read.mpcross(founderfile, finalfile, pedfile, mapfile,
    phenofile)
}
\arguments{
  \item{founderfile}{File containing founder genotypes -
  should have 1+(number of founders) columns. The first
  column contains the marker names - first space left
  blank. The first row for the other columns contains the
  founder name. Additional rows contain observed marker
  data for all founders.}

  \item{finalfile}{File containing final genotypes - should
  have 1+(number of lines) columns. The first column
  contains the marker names - first space left blank. The
  first row for the other columns contains line names.
  Additional rows contain observed marker data for all
  lines.}

  \item{pedfile}{File containing pedigree data - should
  have three or four columns - first three columns indicate
  id, mother and father; fourth column is a flag for
  whether the lines was observed.}

  \item{mapfile}{File containing linkage map - should
  contain three columns - one for marker names, one for
  chromosome assignment and one for map position in cM}

  \item{phenofile}{File containing phenotypic data - should
  contain one column for each phenotype, with rows indexing
  lines.}

\description{
  Generate an mpcross object by reading in components from
  files - requires founders marker data, finals marker
  data, pedigree, and IDs for all lines. Marker map and
  phenotypic data are optional.
